Provider Lookup Application Notes
---------------------------------

(1) As a user I can enter a zip code to view music instructors nearby
    -text field in a form to input zip code
        -submit button
    -valid zip code is within 'a5_locations'.
        -if a zip code is invalid, display an error message
        -else display a report

(2) As a user I can view a report of the selected location containing the following
    -Report heading
        -zip code
        -location name
        -state
    -Report matching
        -display the total number of association members within 25 miles
    -Report table
        -displays information about the nearby people, columns include
            -name
            -provider number
            -subjects taught (comma seperated)
            -the location of the person
            -distance in miles from the user entered zip code
        -data is sorted by closest distance
            -secondary sorting is by provider number
        

Notes
-use 69.0 miles for one degree of latitude or longitude. Distance reported must be 
 accurate within 0.1 miles
-The entire process of gathering the person table (with names, subjects, distance, etc.) 
 can be performed entirely with on MySQL query. You don't have to do it that way, but 
 however you do it you will need to use the distance formula:
 a^2 + b^2 = c^2

 distance = sqrt ((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)

-keep in mind the multiplier of miles for one degree of latitude or longitude:
 distance_miles = distance_deg * 69.0
 
 distance_miles = 69.0 * (sqrt ((change in longitude)^2 + (change in latitude)^2))

-Copper Harbor (49918) has no people within 25 miles
-Dexter (48130) has 16 results
-Kalamazoo (49004) has 13 results
