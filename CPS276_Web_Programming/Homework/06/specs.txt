(1a)As a user I can upload a text file for examination

(1b)As a user I can select one of five papers from a drop down menu for examination

(2)As a user I can analyze the document using Benford's Law.
    -Data needed
        -total number of numbers
        -total numbers starting with each digit
            -print this out
        -the result number
        -indicate whether the data set is "likely authentic" or "likely fake"


Hints:
-drop all numbers starting with '0'
-discard signs (make all numbers positive)
-use file_get_contents() to load a large string of text
-use regular expressions to extract all numeric data
-given a string or number $x, the notation $x{0} will extract the first
character or digit.


The process for scoring a number set for Benford’s Law is as follows:
Given these variables:
$total = the total number of numbers in the set
$d1 = the number of numbers starting with the digit ‘1’
$d2 = the number of numbers starting with the digit ‘2’
$d3 = the number of numbers starting with the digit ‘3’
$d4 ...
$d5
$d6
$d7
$d8
$d9

$result = ((($d1/0.301)+($d2/0.176)+($d3/0.125)+($d4/0.097)+($d5/0.079)
+($d6/0.067)+($d7/0.058)+($d8/0.051)+($d9/0.046))/9)/$total;
